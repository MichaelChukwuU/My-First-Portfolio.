    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
    <p>
      After more than 30 years of service as one of the Navy's top aviators,
      Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a
      courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would
      ground him. Training a detachment of graduates for a special assignment,
      Maverick must confront the ghosts of his past and his deepest fears,
      culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those
      who choose to fly it.

    <h3>Avatar: The way of Water.</h3>
    <p>
      Jake Sully and Ney'tiri have formed a family and are doing everything to
      stay together. However, they must leave their home and explore the regions
      of Pandora. When an ancient threat resurfaces, Jake must fight a difficult
      war against the humans.

    <h3>The NorthMan.</h3>
    <p>
      Prince Amleth is on the verge of becoming a man when his father is
      brutally murdered by his uncle, who kidnaps the boy's mother. Two decades
      later, Amleth is now a Viking who raids Slavic villages. He soon meets a
      seeress who reminds him of his vow -- save his mother, kill his uncle,
